</p>

<p align="center">
  <strong>An interactive, exam-style AFOQT (Air Force Officer Qualifying Test) preparation platform</strong>
</p>

Built using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> to simulate real-world test conditions including section-based timing, structured navigation, and performance evaluation.
</p>

This project was developed using extensive reading materials, official test breakdowns, and publicly available AFOQT FAQs to closely replicate the structure and feel of the actual exam.
</p>


The goal is to provide a realistic, accessible, and completely free practice experience — unlike many paid platforms.
